        <p class="project-title">Voyager Translates</p>
        <p>We offer the only translation app on the market that is customized to military needs, and we offer it exclusively for our clients at no added cost. Basic translation apps currently on the market are essentially virtual language-to-language dictionaries, whereas the best translation apps are backed by neurolingual processing. Neurolingual processing adds a database of more nuanced vocabulary options than a traditional rules-based dictionary and it employs machine learning so that the app improves over time as more consumers use the app. Voyager Translates uses neurolingual processing and is the only app on the market with a database of nuanced vocabulary specific to the language needs of our military and defense clients.</p>
